# Simulation
## Simulation 1: Identity inference attack 
### Cases
1. Number of users: 10
2. User behaviors:
> 1. Share data (by deploying a contract)
> 2. Interact with the contract (Update the contract)
3. So, each user will:
> 1. Deploy their own instance of a data-sharing contract
> 2. Interact with their own contract instance using the update() function
